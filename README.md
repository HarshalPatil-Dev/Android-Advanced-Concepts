#Databinding Vs Kotlin Synthetic(KTX)

Kotlin Synthetic (KTX) can be used to avoid findViewById()  for smaller projects. It is very easy to use and really helpful in some situations.
But it is not a recommended best practice(by google) . Also you will miss a lot of advantages provided by data binding for larger complex projects. If you are planning to build an industrial level Android application with a proper architectural design, I highly recommend you to use data binding.
Some other benefits of Data binding.

1) Update the values automatically.(doesnâ€™t have to keep track of all the ways a value can be updated)
2) More readable code
3) More maintainable code
4) Faster development times
5) Faster execution times
6) Well suited for MVVM and MVI architectures.
7) Errors can be found during the compile time.
8) No limitations comparing with Kotlin synthetic


<H2>Observables</H2>

Work with observable data objects
Observability refers to the capability of an object to notify others about changes in its data. The Data Binding Library allows you to make objects, fields, or collections observable.

Any plain-old object can be used for data binding, but modifying the object doesn't automatically cause the UI to update. Data binding can be used to give your data objects the ability to notify other objects, known as listeners, when its data changes. There are three different types of observable classes: objects, fields, and collections.

When one of these observable data objects is bound to the UI and a property of the data object changes, the UI is updated automatically.


<H2>Kotlin coroutines on Android</H2>
A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and are based on established concepts from other languages.

On Android, coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive. This topic describes how you can use Kotlin coroutines to address these problems, enabling you to write cleaner and more concise app code.

Features
Coroutines is our recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android. Noteworthy features include the following:

<B>Lightweight:</B> You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension, which doesn't block the thread where the coroutine is running. Suspending saves memory over blocking while supporting many concurrent operations.
<B>Fewer memory leaks:</B> Use structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.
<B>Built-in cancellation support:</B> Cancellation is propagated automatically through the running coroutine hierarchy.
<B>Jetpack integration:</B> Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support. Some libraries also provide their own coroutine scope that you can use for structured concurrency.
